## Neural-based Constrained Motion Planning

![compnet-bartender]({{ "/assets/compnet-bartender.gif" | relative_url }})

We increase the speed for solving Constrained Motion Planning (CMP) problems with a neural-based informed sampler, whose generated samples distribute near the constrained manifold and prefer high-promising areas, saving the time of projection and searching. We also introduce an neural-based projector that enable faster projection towards the manifold.

## Robot Motion Imitation

We adopt Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning along with Behavior Cloning to teach a robot by demonstration. An RNN layer is used in this model to extract some overall features of a trajectory.
