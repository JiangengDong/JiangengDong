## Neural-based Constrained Motion Planning

![compnet-bartender]({{ "/assets/compnet-bartender.gif" | relative_url }})

We increase the speed for solving constrained motion planning problems with a neural-based informed sampler. The generated samplers distribute near the constrained manifold and prefer high-promising areas, which saves the time of projection and searching.

## Robot Motion Imitation

We adopt Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning along with Behavior Cloning to teach a robot by demonstration. An RNN layer is used in this model to extract some overall features of a trajectory.
